I have deployed multiple full-stack web applications utilizing JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and React, on top of various static websites for personal and client work. In addition to my tech experience, I have four years of sales history, selling electronics and software. I want to bring my skills to a passionate and customer-focused development team.

When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me at a concert, the cinema, or one of the many beautiful Metroparks in Toledo. I have a great passion for the arts and I love supporting the incredible local artists within my community.
